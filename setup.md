title: Setup
---

You will need to install MATLAB, [GNU Octave][gnu-octave], or use MATLAB Online to do this lesson.

You will also need to download some data, which we will analyze using MATLAB:

**For the MSE Presentation**

1. Download [inflammation-01.csv]({{ page.root}}/data/inflammation-01.csv) and move the file to the MSE folder on your Desktop.
2. Download [nobleGases.csv]({{ page.root}}/data/nobleGases.csv) and move the file to the MSE folder on your Desktop.


For the full lesson:

1. Download [matlab-novice-inflammation.zip]({{ page.root}}/data/matlab-novice-inflammation.zip) and move the file to your Desktop.
2. Extract the zip archive. This will create a `matlab-novice-inflammation` directory containing the data files used in the lesson.
   Note that on Windows, double-clicking on the zip file simply previews the contents: to extract, right-click and select **Extract All**
3. You can access this folder from the Unix shell with:

	~~~
	cd Desktop/matlab-novice-inflammation/
	~~~
	{: .language-bash}
